We're currently working on the time filter in the Yacs team.
But there are still some issues we can't handle at this moment.

1.For the time filter, according to what team leader told us to do, we're supposed to add a filter only return true or false on each section we have on current finding,
however, as I look through the data, each session(unique crn) can have several different array elements stored in since we have different week days and lecture/lab time 
in one week for same course. So, as long as I find one data supposed to be delete, I should also delete the same crn session information from data, but I didn't come
up with a solution for that at this moment.

2.For the front-end, we supposed to create a pop-box that user can select on week day, enter begin time and end time, however, since no one in our group have an 
experience in pop-box, we kind of stuck on how to create a right features in pop-box, and that result we can't read any data to test our algorithm on filter, so that's 
why most of our algorithm in the code are only on adjustment. But we will try to figure out how to do it as soon as possible.
